Compilation of Coding Challenge answers


- ## Flatten Array
    Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].

- ## Temperature Tracker
    Write a class TempTracker with these methods:
    - insert()—records a new temperature.
    - get_max()—returns the highest temp we've seen so far.
    - get_min()—returns the lowest temp we've seen so far.
    - get_mean()—returns the mean of all temps we've seen so far.
    - get_mean() should return a float, but the rest of the getter functions can return integers.
                            
    Temperatures will all be inserted as integers. We'll record our temperatures in Fahrenheit, so we can assume they'll all be in the range 0..110.
